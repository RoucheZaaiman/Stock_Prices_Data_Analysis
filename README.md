# Stock_Prices_Data_Analysis
# Stock Prices Data Analysis   In this project fundamental and more advanced Data Analysis are done on the stock prices of 6 American banks over the timeperiod 2006-2015 to see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016.  The libraries used are Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly and Cufflinks.  A mulitlevel index dataframe is used. The data was scraped from the internet and downloaded as a pickle.  Please bear in mind that this project is meant to practice visualization and Pandas skills; it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice on stock prices.  Due to the nature of Plotly and Cufflinks (not being able to view plots in Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub, I have included screenshots, for a quick view, of all the plots that uses Plotly and Cufflinks.  The banks which stock information we will analyse are: * Bank of America * CitiGroup * Goldman Sachs * JPMorgan Chase * Morgan Stanley * Wells Fargo
